     <bold>The Key points about assingments are-</bold>
     <ol type="i">
    <li>Assignment is a legal term used in the context of the law of contract and of property. </li>
    <li>In both instances, assignment is the process whereby a person, the assignor, transfers rights or benefits to another, the assignee.</li>
    <li>An assignment may not transfer a duty, burden or detriment without the express agreement of the assignee. The right or benefit being assigned may be a gift (such as a waiver) or it may be paid for with a contractual consideration such as money.</li>
    <li>The rights may be vested or contingent,and may include an equitable interest.</li>
    <li>Mortgages and loans are relatively straightforward and amenable to assignment. An assignor may assign rights, such as a mortgage note issued by a third party borrower, and this would require the latter to make repayments to the assignee.</li>
    <li>A related concept of assignment is novation wherein, by agreement with all parties, one contracting party is replaced by a new party. While novation requires the consent of all parties, assignment needs no consent from other non-assigning parties. However, in the case of assignment, the consent of the non-assigning party may be required by a contractual provision.
